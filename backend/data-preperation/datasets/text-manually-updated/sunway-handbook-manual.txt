After considering the available information the Panel may arrive at one of the following outcomes: a. Case Dismissed b. Case Upheld.

**Handling Academic Malpractice: Naive and First Offence** Case Dismissed: 1. HoD advises ASQ and PL on the outcome. 2. PL informs the student, and ASQ to strike the record of an academic malpractice allegation. Case Upheld: **Naive and Minor Offence** 1. Any penalty or sanction is determined at Department and School level in line with the recommended tariffs set out below. 2. HoD informs students and ASQ of the outcome. **Major Offence** The case is referred with a recommended penalty and/or sanction to the Provost. The Provost may confirm, amend, or request the Panel to recommend an alternative penalty or sanction. The Provost’s Office (PO) informs the student, Department, School, and Registry of the outcome.

**Handling Academic Malpractice: Subsequent Offences** Case Dismissed: PO informs student, and ASQ to strike record of an academic malpractice allegation. Case Upheld: **Minor and Major Offence** 1. Panel advises PO of outcome and recommends a penalty and/or sanction to the Provost. 2. The Provost may confirm, amend, or request the Panel to recommend an alternative penalty or sanction. The PO notifies the student, Department, School, and Registry. *Note: If the sanction recommended by the Panel results in dismissal or revocation of any award, the sanction may only be approved by the Vice-Chancellor.*


**Conduct of the Formal Hearing for Academic Malpractice** The student against whom the allegation has been made will be invited to the formal hearing; he/she has the right to be accompanied by a friend for support, but this person must be a member of the University community; a student’s failure to attend or to submit evidence to the Panel will not prevent the Panel from proceeding with its investigation; however, if the student is prevented from attending through ill health or other extenuating circumstances, the Panel may decide to adjourn its proceedings until a later date agreed by the Panel and the student.

**Student Appeal Process for Academic Malpractice** The student against whom an allegation of academic malpractice has been upheld may make an appeal in writing within five (5) working days of receiving notification of the outcome of the Panel of Inquiry Hearing in accordance with Sunway University Student Appeals Policy and Procedure.

**Penalties for Malpractice** If a student is found to have committed malpractice in one or more assessments in a single assessment cycle, the Panel of Inquiry may: decide that no further action is required; require resubmission of the relevant piece(s) of work by a specific deadline as a First Attempt (mark not capped); require resubmission of the relevant piece(s) of work by a specific deadline as a Second Attempt capped at the minimum pass mark; require resubmission of the relevant piece(s) of work by a specific deadline as a Final Attempt capped at the minimum pass mark; recommend repeating the subject and with results capped at the minimum pass mark; deem the student to have failed in the specific element of assessment in which the malpractice occurred; deem the student to have failed in all the assessments for the subject; and make a recommendation about the student’s progression or the conferment of an award in the case where a student is found to have committed grave malpractice or to have infringed more than once; recommend suspension or expulsion from the programme and the University; make a recommendation for the degree or other award that is held by the student to be revoked by the University; if academic malpractice is suspected in group work and if it cannot be established which individual(s) is/are responsible, the whole group will be deemed responsible, provided that there is sufficient evidence to substantiate the allegations on the balance of probability; if collusion is suspected and if after investigation it cannot be established which individual(s) is/are responsible, all students involved will be deemed responsible, provided there is sufficient evidence to substantiate the allegations on the balance of probability; type of offence: Naive, Case Dismissed: 1. Student to resubmit the whole assessment; 2. Marks will not be capped at 40%; Case Upheld: Not applicable; type of offence: First offence, Case Dismissed: 1. Warning letter will be issued; 2. Student to resubmit whole assignment; 3. Marks will be capped at 40%; Case Upheld: 1. Student will be awarded 0 marks and required to repeat the subject; 2. Marks for the repeated subject will be capped at 40%; type of offence: Subsequent offence: Case Dismissed: Not applicable; Case Upheld: 1. Student will be awarded 0 marks and required to repeat the subject; 2. Marks for the repeated subject will be capped at 40%; 3. Suspension of the following semester (Note: Further repeat of academic malpractice will lead to expulsion).

**Assessment Arrangements for Students with Disabilities** The University will make special arrangements where possible to ensure fair assessment of students with disabilities or unforeseen medical circumstances; the following listing contains examples of modifications/adjustments which may need to be made: 1. **Alternative Locations for Assessment** Specific location agreed within a conventional examination room; adapted examination furniture/special lighting provided; separate room for examinations; physical access to the location and to lavatory facilities suitable for the disabled. 2. **Adjustments to the Timing of Assessment** Extra time agreed; rest periods/breaks agreed within a lengthy time-span. 3. **Use of Specific Equipment or Software** Use of PC/laptop for examinations (with restrictions on what can be imported into the examination setting); use of video/tape recorder for oral answers. 4. **Procedures for Making Special Arrangements** Students who need special arrangements are advised to discuss their requirements with the Dean of School at the start of the semester and provide up-to-date documentary evidence to support their needs; a written request is submitted to the Examination Unit with details of specific arrangements and approved by the Dean of School; the request has to be submitted at least four weeks before any examination in order to enable the claim for special needs to be fully considered and arrangements made; students who have had additional arrangements in a previous year should renew the arrangements and indicate any necessary changes to previous requirements; students should be aware that additional examination arrangements will be reported to the chair of the Programme Assessment Board; exceptional arrangements will need to receive the approval of the Chair of the Board who may consult with the appropriate subject lecturers; students who require additional examination arrangements to be made in examinations as a result of unforeseen medical circumstances are required to follow the same process as outlined above, supported by appropriate medical certification; students are required to submit requests and medical certification as soon as possible following the accident/illness/diagnosis in order to allow time for such provision to be made.


**Guidelines on Academic Appeal** Sunway University is committed to giving its students the best experience possible; however, there may be occasions when students may feel that they have grounds to appeal against an academic decision or request for a formal review of a decision made by a Sunway University academic body or officer; the Student Appeals Policy provides a framework for the University to respond to appeals in a way that contributes to the University’s supportive and fair learning environment and is consistent with the principles of fairness and equal opportunity; the University expects students to appreciate that appeals will not always result in their preferred conclusion; regardless of the decision, students will be informed of the outcome of a formal appeal and the reasons for it; the University reserves the right to decline to pursue an appeal, including but not limited to circumstances where another process is more appropriate, or where the student does not have sufficient grounds to lodge an appeal; consideration of an appeal will be restricted to circumstances where: there has been or could have been an incorrect application of policies, procedures or administrative processes that may have disadvantaged the student; there is evidence of mitigating circumstances which may have affected the student’s performance of which the University was not aware when the decision was taken, and which could not reasonably have been presented to the University earlier; there is evidence that the decision made did not take any mitigating circumstances into sufficient account, or that the decision made is manifestly unreasonable; there is evidence of unfair or discriminatory practice; additional relevant evidence has come to light since the decision was taken which could not have been made available earlier; the following matters do not constitute grounds for an appeal: disagreement with a mark or grade or a degree classification awarded; challenges to academic judgements of examiners on an assessment outcome or level of the award granted; claims that academic performance, including attendance, was adversely affected by mitigating circumstances, such as ill-health, but for which no contemporary medical or other appropriate evidence is provided; claims that academic performance, including attendance, was adversely affected by mitigating circumstances, which were not, but which could, reasonably, have been disclosed prior to the decision being made; complaints against delivery of teaching and methods of assessment.

**General Procedure for Appeals** An appeal may be made by completing and submitting the appropriate form for appeals electronically; independent documentary evidence or information which is relevant to the case must be included to support the appeals; for rechecking of assessment marks, an appeal must be made to the Examination Unit, Registry Office by filling in the Student Appeals Form: Assessment Result within fifteen (15) working days from the assessment result release date; for other academic matters, an appeal must be made to the School also within fifteen (15) working days of receiving notification from the School by filling in the Student Appeals Form (Academic Matters); an application which does not satisfy the grounds for appeal as stipulated in the Student Appeals Policy will be dismissed; there are various stages of the appeal process; a student must exhaust any lower level of appeal before proceeding to the next higher level.

**What is the Procedure for Appeal of Academic Decisions?** Students may appeal academic decisions through a two-stage process: Stage 1 involves submitting a formal appeal to the School Appeals Committee, which reviews the evidence and may invite the student to present their case; if the appeal is not upheld, Stage 2 allows the student to escalate the appeal to the Appeals and Special Cases Committee (ASCC) for further consideration; independent documentary evidence must be included, and appeals for rechecking marks should be made within fifteen (15) working days from the assessment result release date.

**Procedure for Appeal: Stage 1 (Appeal to the School)** Under stage 1, appeals shall be considered by the School Appeals Committee or another equivalent committee officially recognised by the University for the purposes of considering student appeals; the Committee shall review the evidence provided by the student, and may in exceptional circumstances, and at its sole discretion, invite the student to present their case in person; the School Appeals Committee may uphold the appeal or reject the appeal; where the appeal is upheld, the Committee shall recommend to the Provost Office such reasonable actions, but excluding any financial compensation, it deems appropriate to remedy the matter; the Committee may defer any decision where it feels a further investigation is necessary to enable a reasonable judgment to be made; if the judgement is deferred, the Chair of the Committee shall initiate necessary investigations and arrange for the Committee to reconvene to reconsider the appeal; when the Committee finds that there are valid circumstances for appeal but is unable to uphold the appeal since it requires the School to operate outside the boundaries of the University Academic Regulations, the Committee shall refer the appeal to Stage 2; except where the appeal is referred to Stage 2, the judgement of the School Appeals Committee will be final.

**Procedure for Appeal: Stage 2 (Appeals to the Appeals and Special Cases Committee)** Under stage 2, appeals shall be considered by the Appeals and Special Cases Committee of the University (ASCC), or other equivalent committee officially recognised by the University for the purposes of considering stage 2 appeals; the student shall be notified on the outcome of the ASCC and any remedial steps to be taken, including the reasons why the appeal was rejected; the Committee may defer any decision where it feels further investigation is necessary to enable reasonable judgment to be made; if judgement is deferred, the Chair of the Committee shall initiate necessary investigations and arrange for the Committee to reconvene to reconsider the appeal; the decision of ASCC is final and there shall be no further rights of appeal.
