**reassessment**. - unless prohibited by professional body regulations, undergraduate students are given two reassessment opportunities in any course that has been failed in the first attempt, except where an irretrievable fail has been awarded as a result of malpractice. the reassessment may take place in the form of repeat or re-sit in accordance with regulations j2.2 and j2.3.. - if the student waives the opportunity to re-sit, the student will have two (2) remaining attempts to repeat the course. upon failing the re-sit at the second attempt, the student is required to repeat the course as the final attempt.. - a repeat is an opportunity to make another attempt at all assessment components of a course.. - for a repeat, the student will have to attend classes and take the failed course in its entirety. the normal tuition fees applicable to the course will be charged. the student will be allowed to take additional courses in the semester on top of the course(s) repeated on the condition that:. i) the total credits taken in the semester do not exceed 19 for a full semester and 10 for a short semester.. ii) accumulated failed credits are below 10 credits.. - a re-sit is an opportunity to make another attempt at the failed assessment component of the course (such as sit for another written examination or re-submit coursework) following a marginal failure (30% - 39%) or a component failure.. - the student will have to pay an rm200 fee for each course reassessed.. - the programme assessment board may consider allowing re-sits for all courses except capstone projects and internships.. - a re-sit may be considered under the following circumstances:. i) marginal failure in courses where the assessment is fully based on coursework (applicable only to students from intakes before march 2017).. ii) a student who marginally failed a course, where it is not required to pass all assessment components, and who has attained an overall course mark that is no more than 10% below the required course passing mark, may re-sit the one or more failed assessment components required to attain the overall passing mark.. iii) students who fail a course due to component failure in a course where it is required for all components to be passed will be offered the opportunity to re-sit the failed component(s), providing that the total mark for all assessment components combined is equivalent to a marginal course failure, that is, the first course failure mark is equivalent to or less than 10% below the required course passing mark.. iv) the course marks after a re-sit are calculated from the total of the marks achieved for the previously passed component(s) and the marks for any component(s) that are reassessed. components may be passed at different times and do not need to be passed in the same assessment cycle.. v) students with one or two marginal course failures from the final semester of study and who have no other outstanding reassessment.. - re-sits need to be conducted at the earliest available opportunity before the end of the subsequent semester.. - students repeating courses due to course or component failure shall be required to attend classes and participate in all learning activities, including those relating to components that have previously been passed.. - marks awarded to students from the august 2019 intake onwards will be based on the actual marks obtained in the reassessment attempt and will not be capped. however, grades from failed attempt(s) will be recorded in the progress report and transcript. if the student has to repeat the course in another semester, the failed attempt will contribute towards the gpa. cgpa will only be calculated based on the student’s latest reassessment attempt.. - the maximum mark that can be awarded for any course after reassessment due to course failure or component failure is the minimum passing mark (applicable for intakes prior to august 2019). if the previous mark and the reassessed marks are below the minimum pass mark, then the highest of the marks for the course and/or component will be counted as the final mark.. - students from the 2013 intake onwards are allowed to repeat a passed course if required for professional accreditation under specific accreditation arrangements. however, the marks obtained in the subsequent attempt(s) will not be recorded on the student’s transcript and will not be used in any calculation of the student’s programme marks or grade. the marks and/or grades of any assessment repeated for professional accreditation will be recorded in a separate letter issued by the registrar to confirm the examination results.. lecturers setting coursework for re-sit must fulfill the following criteria:. i. only set for 1 coursework (not required to follow existing coursework components setting).. ii. coursework weightage must be at least 30% of the overall subject.. iii. coursework must be individual work. (BCS, 37)

**condonement**. a student who, after failing all opportunities to pass a course but has achieved a mark of between 30% and 39% in any of the attempts, may be given condonement for the said course. the failed course must be proposed to the programme assessment board for condonement. the maximum that can be condoned is 12 credits for a bachelor’s degree. conditions for condonement are as follows:. i) all programme learning outcomes continue to be met;. ii) the mark for the course is at least 30% in any of the attempts;. iii) the mark for the failed assessment component (referring to component failure) is no more than 10% below the minimum component pass mark in any of the attempts;. iv) the student’s cgpa at the time of condonement is at least 2.00;. v) professional body requirements do not stipulate that all assessment components must be passed and do not prohibit condonement. (BCS, 38)

**mandatory exit**. a student with outstanding failures after all opportunities for reassessment have been exhausted will be required to exit from the programme. (BCS, 39)

**programme award and results**. awards are recommended by the programme assessment board (pab). in order to be recommended for the award, students must have:. - achieved passes in the credit requirements specified for the award.. - passed any additional requirements specified by the programme associated with the award, including compulsory courses, defined combinations of courses, and placements.. - achieved a cgpa greater than or equal to 2.00 from courses that are taken into account towards the award classification.. - met any required professional or statutory body  (BCS, 39)

**honours degree award classification**. the classification of awards will be based on the cumulative grade points average of contributing courses. the contributing courses for an honours degree are derived from the results of year 2 and year 3 only. typically, for bachelor’s level, year 1 courses, mpu courses, and internships are not calculated towards the overall award marks and classification.. the classification of degree awards with honours is as follows:. cgpa classification:. - 3.50 – 4.00: class i. - 3.00 – 3.49: class ii - i. - 2.50 – 2.99: class ii - ii. - 2.00 – 2.49: class iii. (BCS, 39)

**calculation of grade point average**. grade point average (gpa) is calculated by multiplying the grading point by course credit and dividing the figure by the total number of credits taken in a semester. the formula is as follows:. gpa = sum of (grading point x course credits) for all courses / sum (total number of credits). upon completion of study, students will receive a cumulative grade point average (cgpa). students may refer to the academic regulations for a sample calculation of gpa and cgpa. (BCS, 40)

**higher class award**. a higher class shall be awarded when a student’s overall profile falls into the following scenario:. i) the cumulative grade point average (cgpa) is not more than 0.05 points below the recommended class; and. ii) at least half of the counting credits, or half + 0.5 in the case of an uneven number of credits, are in the recommended class. (BCS, 40)

**academic standing**. determination of students’ academic standing is based on gpa and cgpa:. i) **good standing** - a student is in good standing whenever the student’s cgpa is 2.00 or above.. ii) **warning** - whenever the gpa for any enrolment period is less than 2.00, but the cgpa is 2.00 or above, the student will receive a warning notification.. iii) **probation** - the student will be placed on probation whenever the student’s cgpa falls below 2.00.. iv) **extended probation** - the student will be placed on extended probation when, following a semester on probation, the student’s cgpa is still below 2.00, even though the gpa for the enrolment period is 2.00 or above. students with this status may only be permitted to register for a maximum of 12 credits.. v) **final probation** - the student will be placed on final probation when, following a semester on extended probation, the student’s cgpa continues to be below 2.00, even though the student’s gpa for the enrolment period is 2.00 or above. students may only register for no more than 12 credits in that particular semester.. vi) **dismissal** - students on extended probation who fail to achieve at least a 2.00 gpa for the enrolment period, or students on final probation who fail to achieve a 2.00 cgpa, will have to exit the programme.. (BCS, 40)

**appeal process**. a student who is dissatisfied with the result of an examination or other decisions by the assessment board may submit a formal application of appeal to either the examination unit or school. please refer to the student handbook for more details. (BCS, 41)

The invigilator must record the action taken in their report of the examination. 4.1.3 No later than one (1) working day after the conclusion of the examination, the invigilator will submit the Academic Malpractice Notification Form and a report to the Director of Student Administration and Programme Leader. 4.1.4 The report from the invigilator should provide an account of malpractice (including the time of the incident and the student’s response to the allegation) and be accompanied by any relevant supporting evidence (including any confiscated materials). Where possible, the report should include comments and signatures of other invigilators who were present at the time the alleged malpractice took place. 4.1.5 Thereafter, the Academic Malpractice Investigation procedure will take place. (Sunway Student Handbook, 64)

**Academic Malpractice Investigation Procedure** - 4.2.1 Upon receipt of the Academic Malpractice Notification form, the Programme Leader will inform the student in writing of the allegation, enclosing the report, and providing a copy of this document so that the student understands the procedure to be followed in such cases. The student will be given five (5) working days from sending the written notice to respond to the allegation and will be informed that: a. if the student does not reply within the time stipulated it will be assumed that the student has admitted the malpractice. Then the necessary procedures shall be conducted in a form commensurate with the nature of the malpractice. b. if the student wishes to contest the allegation, he/she must give written notice to that effect to the Programme Leader within five (5) working days from the date that the original notice was sent. 4.2.2 The academic malpractice investigation procedures applied will be determined by whether the student has previously committed an academic offence. (Sunway Student Handbook, 66)

**Naïve Offence and First Offence** - 4.3.1 Instances of first offences will be dealt with Programme Leaders who will establish whether a prima facie case exists. Once a prima facie case is established the case is to be reported to HOD and ASQ. 4.3.2 HOD will convene a Panel of Inquiry consisting of three members of academic staff. The Panel should not include a member of staff involved in delivering or assessing the course(s) concerned. The student and Programme Leader will also be invited to attend the hearing. One academic staff member should be appointed as Secretary for the Panel. 4.3.3 The Panel will review the evidence and ask the student to present any information or reasons that may disprove the allegation. After considering the available information the Panel may arrive at one of the following outcomes: a. Case Dismissed b. Case Upheld. (Sunway Student Handbook, 6)

**Subsequent Offences** - 4.4.1 If the alleged academic malpractice is not a first offence the case will be referred to the Provost’s Office. The Provost will convene a Panel of Inquiry of three members of academic staff who are not involved in delivering or assessing the course(s) concerned. The Provost will appoint the Panel chair and an administrative staff member to act as Secretary for the Panel. The student will be invited to the Panel hearing and the Panel may also invite the Programme Leader, subject leader, HoD or any other person with knowledge relevant to the case. 4.4.2 The panel will review the evidence and ask the student to present any information or reasons that may disprove the allegation. After considering the available information the Panel may arrive at one of the following outcomes: a. Case Dismissed b. Case Upheld. (Sunway Student Handbook, 67)

**Handling Academic Malpractice: Naive and First Offence** Case Dismissed: 1. HoD advises ASQ and PL on the outcome. 2. PL informs the student, and ASQ to strike the record of an academic malpractice allegation. Case Upheld: **Naive and Minor Offence** 1. Any penalty or sanction is determined at Department and School level in line with the recommended tariffs set out below. 2. HoD informs students and ASQ of the outcome. **Major Offence** The case is referred with a recommended penalty and/or sanction to the Provost. The Provost may confirm, amend, or request the Panel to recommend an alternative penalty or sanction. The Provost’s Office (PO) informs the student, Department, School, and Registry of the outcome. (Sunway Student Handbook, 68)

**Handling Academic Malpractice: Subsequent Offences** Case Dismissed: PO informs student, and ASQ to strike record of an academic malpractice allegation. Case Upheld: **Minor and Major Offence** 1. Panel advises PO of outcome and recommends a penalty and/or sanction to the Provost. 2. The Provost may confirm, amend, or request the Panel to recommend an alternative penalty or sanction. The PO notifies the student, Department, School, and Registry. *Note: If the sanction recommended by the Panel results in dismissal or revocation of any award, the sanction may only be approved by the Vice-Chancellor.* (Sunway Student Handbook, 68)


**Conduct of the Formal Hearing for Academic Malpractice** The student against whom the allegation has been made will be invited to the formal hearing; he/she has the right to be accompanied by a friend for support, but this person must be a member of the University community; a student’s failure to attend or to submit evidence to the Panel will not prevent the Panel from proceeding with its investigation; however, if the student is prevented from attending through ill health or other extenuating circumstances, the Panel may decide to adjourn its proceedings until a later date agreed by the Panel and the student. (Sunway Student Handbook, 69)

**Student Appeal Process for Academic Malpractice** The student against whom an allegation of academic malpractice has been upheld may make an appeal in writing within five (5) working days of receiving notification of the outcome of the Panel of Inquiry Hearing in accordance with Sunway University Student Appeals Policy and Procedure. (Sunway Student Handbook, 69)

**Penalties for Malpractice** If a student is found to have committed malpractice in one or more assessments in a single assessment cycle, the Panel of Inquiry may: decide that no further action is required; require resubmission of the relevant piece(s) of work by a specific deadline as a First Attempt (mark not capped); require resubmission of the relevant piece(s) of work by a specific deadline as a Second Attempt capped at the minimum pass mark; require resubmission of the relevant piece(s) of work by a specific deadline as a Final Attempt capped at the minimum pass mark; recommend repeating the subject and with results capped at the minimum pass mark; deem the student to have failed in the specific element of assessment in which the malpractice occurred; deem the student to have failed in all the assessments for the subject; and make a recommendation about the student’s progression or the conferment of an award in the case where a student is found to have committed grave malpractice or to have infringed more than once; recommend suspension or expulsion from the programme and the University; make a recommendation for the degree or other award that is held by the student to be revoked by the University; if academic malpractice is suspected in group work and if it cannot be established which individual(s) is/are responsible, the whole group will be deemed responsible, provided that there is sufficient evidence to substantiate the allegations on the balance of probability; if collusion is suspected and if after investigation it cannot be established which individual(s) is/are responsible, all students involved will be deemed responsible, provided there is sufficient evidence to substantiate the allegations on the balance of probability; type of offence: Naive, Case Dismissed: 1. Student to resubmit the whole assessment; 2. Marks will not be capped at 40%; Case Upheld: Not applicable; type of offence: First offence, Case Dismissed: 1. Warning letter will be issued; 2. Student to resubmit whole assignment; 3. Marks will be capped at 40%; Case Upheld: 1. Student will be awarded 0 marks and required to repeat the subject; 2. Marks for the repeated subject will be capped at 40%; type of offence: Subsequent offence: Case Dismissed: Not applicable; Case Upheld: 1. Student will be awarded 0 marks and required to repeat the subject; 2. Marks for the repeated subject will be capped at 40%; 3. Suspension of the following semester (Note: Further repeat of academic malpractice will lead to expulsion). (Sunway Student Handbook, 69)

**Assessment Arrangements for Students with Disabilities** The University will make special arrangements where possible to ensure fair assessment of students with disabilities or unforeseen medical circumstances; the following listing contains examples of modifications/adjustments which may need to be made: 1. **Alternative Locations for Assessment** Specific location agreed within a conventional examination room; adapted examination furniture/special lighting provided; separate room for examinations; physical access to the location and to lavatory facilities suitable for the disabled. 2. **Adjustments to the Timing of Assessment** Extra time agreed; rest periods/breaks agreed within a lengthy time-span. 3. **Use of Specific Equipment or Software** Use of PC/laptop for examinations (with restrictions on what can be imported into the examination setting); use of video/tape recorder for oral answers. 4. **Procedures for Making Special Arrangements** Students who need special arrangements are advised to discuss their requirements with the Dean of School at the start of the semester and provide up-to-date documentary evidence to support their needs; a written request is submitted to the Examination Unit with details of specific arrangements and approved by the Dean of School; the request has to be submitted at least four weeks before any examination in order to enable the claim for special needs to be fully considered and arrangements made; students who have had additional arrangements in a previous year should renew the arrangements and indicate any necessary changes to previous requirements; students should be aware that additional examination arrangements will be reported to the chair of the Programme Assessment Board; exceptional arrangements will need to receive the approval of the Chair of the Board who may consult with the appropriate subject lecturers; students who require additional examination arrangements to be made in examinations as a result of unforeseen medical circumstances are required to follow the same process as outlined above, supported by appropriate medical certification; students are required to submit requests and medical certification as soon as possible following the accident/illness/diagnosis in order to allow time for such provision to be made. (Sunway Student Handbook, 71)


**Guidelines on Academic Appeal** Sunway University is committed to giving its students the best experience possible; however, there may be occasions when students may feel that they have grounds to appeal against an academic decision or request for a formal review of a decision made by a Sunway University academic body or officer; the Student Appeals Policy provides a framework for the University to respond to appeals in a way that contributes to the University’s supportive and fair learning environment and is consistent with the principles of fairness and equal opportunity; the University expects students to appreciate that appeals will not always result in their preferred conclusion; regardless of the decision, students will be informed of the outcome of a formal appeal and the reasons for it; the University reserves the right to decline to pursue an appeal, including but not limited to circumstances where another process is more appropriate, or where the student does not have sufficient grounds to lodge an appeal; consideration of an appeal will be restricted to circumstances where: there has been or could have been an incorrect application of policies, procedures or administrative processes that may have disadvantaged the student; there is evidence of mitigating circumstances which may have affected the student’s performance of which the University was not aware when the decision was taken, and which could not reasonably have been presented to the University earlier; there is evidence that the decision made did not take any mitigating circumstances into sufficient account, or that the decision made is manifestly unreasonable; there is evidence of unfair or discriminatory practice; additional relevant evidence has come to light since the decision was taken which could not have been made available earlier; the following matters do not constitute grounds for an appeal: disagreement with a mark or grade or a degree classification awarded; challenges to academic judgements of examiners on an assessment outcome or level of the award granted; claims that academic performance, including attendance, was adversely affected by mitigating circumstances, such as ill-health, but for which no contemporary medical or other appropriate evidence is provided; claims that academic performance, including attendance, was adversely affected by mitigating circumstances, which were not, but which could, reasonably, have been disclosed prior to the decision being made; complaints against delivery of teaching and methods of assessment. (Sunway Student Handbook, 73)

**General Procedure for Appeals** An appeal may be made by completing and submitting the appropriate form for appeals electronically; independent documentary evidence or information which is relevant to the case must be included to support the appeals; for rechecking of assessment marks, an appeal must be made to the Examination Unit, Registry Office by filling in the Student Appeals Form: Assessment Result within fifteen (15) working days from the assessment result release date; for other academic matters, an appeal must be made to the School also within fifteen (15) working days of receiving notification from the School by filling in the Student Appeals Form (Academic Matters); an application which does not satisfy the grounds for appeal as stipulated in the Student Appeals Policy will be dismissed; there are various stages of the appeal process; a student must exhaust any lower level of appeal before proceeding to the next higher level. (Sunway Student Handbook, 74)

**What is the Procedure for Appeal of Academic Decisions?** Students may appeal academic decisions through a two-stage process: Stage 1 involves submitting a formal appeal to the School Appeals Committee, which reviews the evidence and may invite the student to present their case; if the appeal is not upheld, Stage 2 allows the student to escalate the appeal to the Appeals and Special Cases Committee (ASCC) for further consideration; independent documentary evidence must be included, and appeals for rechecking marks should be made within fifteen (15) working days from the assessment result release date. (Sunway Student Handbook, 74)

**Procedure for Appeal: Stage 1 (Appeal to the School)** Under stage 1, appeals shall be considered by the School Appeals Committee or another equivalent committee officially recognised by the University for the purposes of considering student appeals; the Committee shall review the evidence provided by the student, and may in exceptional circumstances, and at its sole discretion, invite the student to present their case in person; the School Appeals Committee may uphold the appeal or reject the appeal; where the appeal is upheld, the Committee shall recommend to the Provost Office such reasonable actions, but excluding any financial compensation, it deems appropriate to remedy the matter; the Committee may defer any decision where it feels a further investigation is necessary to enable a reasonable judgment to be made; if the judgement is deferred, the Chair of the Committee shall initiate necessary investigations and arrange for the Committee to reconvene to reconsider the appeal; when the Committee finds that there are valid circumstances for appeal but is unable to uphold the appeal since it requires the School to operate outside the boundaries of the University Academic Regulations, the Committee shall refer the appeal to Stage 2; except where the appeal is referred to Stage 2, the judgement of the School Appeals Committee will be final. (Sunway Student Handbook, 74)

**Procedure for Appeal: Stage 2 (Appeals to the Appeals and Special Cases Committee)** Under stage 2, appeals shall be considered by the Appeals and Special Cases Committee of the University (ASCC), or other equivalent committee officially recognised by the University for the purposes of considering stage 2 appeals; the student shall be notified on the outcome of the ASCC and any remedial steps to be taken, including the reasons why the appeal was rejected; the Committee may defer any decision where it feels further investigation is necessary to enable reasonable judgment to be made; if judgement is deferred, the Chair of the Committee shall initiate necessary investigations and arrange for the Committee to reconvene to reconsider the appeal; the decision of ASCC is final and there shall be no further rights of appeal.
