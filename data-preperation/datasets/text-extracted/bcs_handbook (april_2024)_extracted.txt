graduation.
note:
• only grade p (pass) or f (fail) is denoted for internship courses.
• for students enrolled on courses offered under a different grading
scheme, a grade conversion formula will be applied to convert the
course’s grade to the correct programme grading.
5.4 additional requirement to pass a subject
computing courses in this programme require the students to pass both
continuous assessment and final assessment severally to pass the subject.
for this purpose, all continuous assessments for the course are taken
together by their weighted-average as a single assessment component and
are not considered separately.
a failure of either assessment component will result in a fail grade, even if
the total mark is 40 or above. such failure of course due to failure in either
assessment component is referred to herein as component failure. it is
considered similar to a course failure with regard to study progression.
applicable for component failures only
i. students repeating courses due to course or component failure shall be
required to attend classes and participate in all learning activities
including those relating to components which have previously been
passed.
6. publication of coursework marks and examination results
6.1 publication of results
examination results will be posted on izone after endorsement by the
programme assessment board. all marks are considered provisional until
confirmation is given by the programme assessment board.
356.2 return of marked assignments
marks for coursework (e.g. assignments, presentations, learning tasks, etc.)
will be published on elearn no later than three (3) teaching weeks from the
submission deadline. the university practice for return of marked
assignments is normally within two to four weeks of the submission deadline.
lecturers may mark the assignments either by annotating the electronic copy
or by writing on the paper copy. it is the student’s responsibility to collect
the marked assignments. any marked assignments not collected within one
month will be destroyed.
7. progression
decisions on progression of a student pursuing an award are made by the
programme assessment board (pab). progression in any award is dependent on
achieving a minimum pass of 40% or had exemptions given, in all courses.
7.1 progression
• a student who passes all courses in a semester will progress to the
following semester.
• a student who has accumulated 3 failed courses or more, or 10
credits of courses will not be allowed to take new courses in the
following semester. however, an exception can be made if the
failed courses are not offered in the following semester whereby the
student will be allowed to take up to a maximum of 3 new courses
(not more than 12 credits) in order to fulfil requirements for full-
time study provided that the failed courses are not pre-requisites
for the new courses.
• unless prohibited by professional body regulations, undergraduate
students are given two (2) reassessment opportunities in any
courses which has been failed in the first attempt, except where an
irretrievable fail has been awarded as a result of malpractice. the
reassessment may take place in the form of repeat or re-sit in
accordance to the stipulated conditions (7.2)
if the student waives the opportunity to re-sit, he/she will have 2
remaining attempts to repeat the courses. if the student decides to
sit for re-sit and fail again, he/ she will have only one (1)
reassessment opportunity left and is required to repeat the courses
as the final attempt.
at any point, the student will be required to repeat the courses at
the first available opportunity.
• please also refer to section 8.4 for other conditions that can affect
the progression of a student
367.2 reassesment
• unless prohibited by professional body regulations, undergraduate
students are given two reassessment opportunities in any course
which has been failed in the first attempt, except where an
irretrievable fail has been awarded as a result of malpractice. the
reassessment may take place in the form of repeat or re-sit in
accordance to regulations j2.2 and j2.3.
• if the student waives the opportunity to re-sit, the student will have
two (2) remaining attempts to repeat the course. upon failing the re-
sit at the second attempt, student is required to repeat the course as
the final attempt.
• a repeat is an opportunity to make another attempt at all assessment
components of a course.
• for a repeat, the student will have to attend classes and take the failed
course in its entirety. the normal tuition fees as applicable to the
course will be charged. the student will be allowed to take additional
courses in the semester on top of the course/s repeated on condition
that
i) the total credits taken in the semester does not exceed 19 for
a full semester and 10 for a short semester.
ii) accumulated failed credit is below 10 credits.
• a re-sit is an opportunity to make another attempt at the failed
assessment component of the course (such as sit for another written
examination or re-submit coursework) following a marginal failure
(30% - 39%) or a component failure.
• the student will have to pay a rm200 fee for each course reassessed.
• programme assessment board may consider allowing re-sit for all
courses except capstone project and internship.
• a re-sit may be considered under the following circumstances:
i) marginal failure in courses where the assessment is fully based on
coursework (applicable only to students from intakes before
march 2017).
ii) a student who marginally failed a course, where it is not required
to pass all assessment components, and who have attained an
overall course mark that is no more than 10% below the required
course passing mark, may re-sit the one or more failed assessment
components required to attain the overall passing mark.
iii) students who fail a course due to component failure in a course
where it is required for all components to be passed will be offered
the opportunity to re-sit the failed component(s), providing that
the total mark for all assessment components combined is
equivalent to a marginal course failure, that is the first course
failure mark is equivalent or less than 10% below the required
course passing mark.
37iv) the course marks after a re-sit are calculated from the total of the
marks achieved for the previously passed component(s) and the
marks for any component(s) that are reassessed. components may
be passed at different times and do not need to be passed in the
same assessment cycle.
v) students with one or two marginal course failures from the final
semester of study and who have no other outstanding
reassessment.
• re-sit needs to be conducted at the earliest available opportunity
before the end of the subsequent semester.
• students repeating courses due to course or component failure shall
be required to attend classes and participate in all learning activities
including those relating to components which have previously been
passed.
• marks awarded to students from august 2019 intake onwards will be
based on the actual marks obtained in the re-assessment attempt and
will not be capped. however, grades from failed attempt(s) will be
recorded in the progress report and transcript. if the student has to
repeat the course in another semester, the failed attempt will
contribute towards the gpa. cgpa will only be calculated based on
the student’s latest reassessment attempt.
• the maximum mark that can be awarded for any course after
reassessment due to course failure or component failure is the
minimum passing mark (applicable for intakes prior to august 2019).
if the previous mark and the reassessed marks are below the
minimum pass mark, then the highest of the marks for the course and/
or component will be counted as the final mark.
• students from 2013 intake onwards are allowed to repeat a passed
course if required for professional accreditation under specific
accreditation arrangements. however, the marks obtained in the
subsequent attempt(s) will not be recorded on student’s transcript
and will not be used in any calculation of student’s programme marks
or grade. the marks and/ or grades of any assessment repeated for
professional accreditation will be recorded in a separate letter issued
by the registrar to confirm the examination results.
lecturers setting coursework for re-sit, must fulfil the following criteria:
i. only set for 1 coursework (not required to follow existing
coursework components setting)
ii. coursework weightage must be at least 30% of overall subject
iii. coursework must be individual work.
7.3 condonement
a student who after failing all opportunities to pass a course but had
achieved a mark of between 30% and 39% in any of the attempts may be
given condonement for the said course. the failed course must be proposed
38to the programme assessment board for condonement. the maximum that
can be condoned is 12 credits for a bachelor’s degree.
conditions for condonement are as below:
i) all programme learning outcomes continue to be met;
ii) the mark for the course is at least 30% in any of the attempts;
iii) the mark for the failed assessment component (referring to
component failure) is no more than 10% below the minimum
component pass mark in any of the attempts;
iv) the student’s cgpa at time of condonement is at least 2.00;
v) professional body requirements do not stipulate that all
assessment components must be passed and do not prohibit
condonement.
7.3 mandatory exit
a student with outstanding failures after all opportunities of reassessment
have been exhausted, will be required to exit from the programme.
8. programme award and results
awards are recommended by the programme assessment board (pab). in order
to be recommended for the award, students must have:
• achieved passes in the credit requirements specified for the award.
• passed any additional requirements specified by the programme
associated with the award, including compulsory courses, defined
combinations of courses and placements.
• achieved cgpa greater than or equal to 2.00 from courses that are
taken into account towards the award classification.
• met any required professional or statutory body requirements for the
award
8.1 honours degree award classification
the classification of awards will be based on the cumulative grade points average
of contributing courses. the contributing courses for an honours degree are
derived from the results of year 2 and year 3 only. typically, for bachelor’s level,
year 1 courses, mpu courses, and internship are not calculated towards the
overall award marks and classification.
the classification of degree awards, with honours, are as follows:
39cgpa classification
3.50 – 4.00 class i
3.00 – 3.49 class ii (i)
2.50 – 2.99 class ii (ii)
2.00 – 2.49 class iii
8.2 calculation grade point average
grade point average (gpa) is calculated by multiplying grading point with
course credit and dividing the figure by the number of total credits taken in
a semester. formula as below :
gpa = sum of (grading point x course credits) for all courses
sum (total number of credits)
upon completion of study, student will get a cumulative grade point average
(cgpa).
student may refer to the academic regulations for a sample calculation of
gpa, and cgpa.
8.3 a higher class shall be awarded when a student’s overall profile falls into the
following scenario:
i) the cumulative grade point average (cgpa) is not more than 0.05 points
below the recommended class; and
ii) at least half of the counting credits, or half + 0.5 in the case of an uneven
number of credits are in the recommended class.
8.4 academic standing
determination of students’ academic standing is based on gpa and cgpa
i) good standing - a student is in good standing whenever the student’s
cgpa is at 2.00 or above.
ii) warning - whenever the gpa for any enrolment period is less than 2.00,
but the cgpa is 2.00 or above, the student will receive a warning
notification.
iii) probation - the student will be placed on probation whenever the
student’s cgpa falls below 2.00.
iv) extended probation - the student will be placed on extended probation
when, following a semester on probation, the student’s cgpa is still
below 2.00, even though the gpa for the enrolment period is 2.00 or
40above. students with this status may only be permitted to register a
maximum of 12 credits.
v) final probation - the student will be placed on final probation when,
following a semester on extended probation, the student’s cgpa
continues to be below 2.00, even though the student’s gpa for the
enrolment period is 2.00 or above. students may only register not more
than 12 credits in that particular semester.
vi) dismissal - students on extended probation who fails to achieve at least
a 2.00 gpa for the enrolment period, or students on final probation who
fails to achieve a 2.00 cgpa will have to exit the programme.
8.5 a student who is dissatisfied with the result of an examination or other
decision by the assessment board may submit a formal application of appeal
to either examination unit or school. please refer to student handbook for
more details.
