**Submission of assignments**

Assignments must be submitted by the deadline and in the required format (either hardcopy, electronic, or any other format specified). Electronic copies must be submitted through the "Turnitin" software available in eLearn. Please refer to the student handbook for information on academic malpractice.





**Extensions and Penalties for Late Submissions**

The university requires students to adhere to submission deadlines for any form of assessment. Course lecturers have the authority to approve extensions of deadlines for coursework within their own courses, and such agreements will be documented. 

Extensions must be requested by students to the course lecturer in advance of the deadline, and proper justifications must be provided for the request. Any work submitted after the deadline, or after any period of extension granted, shall be marked as a fail or awarded a zero. With strong justification(s), a student may appeal to the school against a fail or zero-mark result for a late submission of an assessment component. If the appeal case is upheld, the result of the assessment component will be capped at minimum passing marks.





**Grading Scheme**

Sunway University operates a standard grading scheme based on percentages to denote student performance in each course as follows:

| Marks (%) | Points | Grade | Description  |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------------|
| 80 – 100  | 4.00   | A+    | Distinction  |
| 75 – 79   | 3.75   | A     | Merit        |
| 70 – 74   | 3.50   | A-    | Merit        |
| 65 – 69   | 3.25   | B+    | Good         |
| 60 – 64   | 3.00   | B     | Good         |
| 55 – 59   | 2.75   | B-    | Satisfactory |
| 50 – 54   | 2.50   | C     | Satisfactory |
| 45 – 49   | 2.25   | C-    | Satisfactory |
| 40 – 44   | 2.00   | D     | Pass         |
| 30 – 39   | 1.50   | F     | Fail         |
| 20 – 29   | 1.00   | F     |              |
| 0 – 19    | 0      | F     |              |

Notes:
1. A student fails a course that does not have the requirement to pass both continuous and final assessment components.
2. A student fails both assessment components of a course that has the requirement to pass both continuous and final assessment components.
3. A failed grade (1.50 F*) occurs where a student has failed one component of a course that has the requirement to pass both continuous and final assessment components.
4. A condoned failure (1.50 F#) occurs when a student has failed at the third attempt but is allowed to progress by the assessment board.
5. A pass at resit attempt is denoted by *.
6. A pass at repeat attempt is denoted by **.
7. "Ex" denotes exemption; "Inc" denotes incomplete; "P" denotes pass; "P**" denotes pass internship at repeat attempt.
8. (Z) indicates a course that is in progress—no credits or marks have been awarded as yet.
9. (F) denotes a failed elective course that has been replaced by an alternative course.
10. (W) denotes withdrawn.
11. (^) denotes credit transfer from another programme.
12. (AU) indicates an audit course taken voluntarily to enhance knowledge but will not be included in the total credit hours required for graduation.

Note:
- Only grade P (pass) or F (fail) is denoted for internship courses.
- For students enrolled in courses offered under a different grading scheme, a grade conversion formula will be applied to convert the course’s grade to the correct programme grading.





**Additional Requirement to Pass a Subject**

Computing courses in this programme require students to pass both continuous assessment and final assessment separately to pass the subject. For this purpose, all continuous assessments for the course are combined by their weighted average as a single assessment component and are not considered separately. A failure of either assessment component will result in a fail grade, even if the total mark is 40 or above. Such a failure due to a failure in either assessment component is referred to herein as component failure. It is considered similar to a course failure with regard to study progression.

Applicable for component failures only:
i. Students repeating courses due to course or component failure shall be required to attend classes and participate in all learning activities, including those relating to components that have previously been passed.





**Publication of Results**

Examination results will be posted on iZone after endorsement by the Programme Assessment Board. All marks are considered provisional until confirmation is given by the Programme Assessment Board.





**Return of Marked Assignments**

Marks for coursework (e.g., assignments, presentations, learning tasks, etc.) will be published on eLearn no later than three (3) teaching weeks from the submission deadline. The university practice for the return of marked assignments is normally within two to four weeks of the submission deadline. Lecturers may mark the assignments either by annotating the electronic copy or by writing on the paper copy. It is the student’s responsibility to collect the marked assignments. Any marked assignments not collected within one month will be destroyed.





**Progression**

Decisions on the progression of a student pursuing an award are made by the Programme Assessment Board (PAB). Progression in any award is dependent on achieving a minimum pass of 40% or having exemptions granted in all courses.

- A student who passes all courses in a semester will progress to the following semester.
- A student who has accumulated 3 failed courses or more, or 10 credits of failed courses, will not be allowed to take new courses in the following semester. However, an exception can be made if the failed courses are not offered in the following semester, whereby the student will be allowed to take up to a maximum of 3 new courses (not more than 12 credits) in order to fulfill requirements for full-time study, provided that the failed courses are not prerequisites for the new courses.
- Unless prohibited by professional body regulations, undergraduate students are given two (2) reassessment opportunities in any course that has been failed in the first attempt, except where an irretrievable fail has been awarded as a result of malpractice. The reassessment may take place in the form of repeat or re-sit in accordance with the stipulated conditions (7.2). If the student waives the opportunity to re-sit, he/she will have 2 remaining attempts to repeat the course. If the student decides to sit for the re-sit and fails again, he/she will have only one (1) reassessment opportunity left and is required to repeat the course as the final attempt. At any point, the student will be required to repeat the course at the first available opportunity.
- Please also refer to section 8.4 for other conditions that can affect the progression of a student.





**Reassessment**

- Unless prohibited by professional body regulations, undergraduate students are given two reassessment opportunities in any course that has been failed in the first attempt, except where an irretrievable fail has been awarded as a result of malpractice. The reassessment may take place in the form of repeat or re-sit in accordance with regulations J2.2 and J2.3.
  
- If the student waives the opportunity to re-sit, the student will have two (2) remaining attempts to repeat the course. Upon failing the re-sit at the second attempt, the student is required to repeat the course as the final attempt.

- A repeat is an opportunity to make another attempt at all assessment components of a course.

- For a repeat, the student will have to attend classes and take the failed course in its entirety. The normal tuition fees applicable to the course will be charged. The student will be allowed to take additional courses in the semester on top of the course(s) repeated on the condition that:
  i) The total credits taken in the semester do not exceed 19 for a full semester and 10 for a short semester.
  ii) Accumulated failed credits are below 10 credits.

- A re-sit is an opportunity to make another attempt at the failed assessment component of the course (such as sit for another written examination or re-submit coursework) following a marginal failure (30% - 39%) or a component failure.

- The student will have to pay an RM200 fee for each course reassessed.

- The Programme Assessment Board may consider allowing re-sits for all courses except capstone projects and internships.

- A re-sit may be considered under the following circumstances:
  i) Marginal failure in courses where the assessment is fully based on coursework (applicable only to students from intakes before March 2017).
  ii) A student who marginally failed a course, where it is not required to pass all assessment components, and who has attained an overall course mark that is no more than 10% below the required course passing mark, may re-sit the one or more failed assessment components required to attain the overall passing mark.
  iii) Students who fail a course due to component failure in a course where it is required for all components to be passed will be offered the opportunity to re-sit the failed component(s), providing that the total mark for all assessment components combined is equivalent to a marginal course failure, that is, the first course failure mark is equivalent to or less than 10% below the required course passing mark.
  iv) The course marks after a re-sit are calculated from the total of the marks achieved for the previously passed component(s) and the marks for any component(s) that are reassessed. Components may be passed at different times and do not need to be passed in the same assessment cycle.
  v) Students with one or two marginal course failures from the final semester of study and who have no other outstanding reassessment.

- Re-sits need to be conducted at the earliest available opportunity before the end of the subsequent semester.

- Students repeating courses due to course or component failure shall be required to attend classes and participate in all learning activities, including those relating to components that have previously been passed.

- Marks awarded to students from the August 2019 intake onwards will be based on the actual marks obtained in the reassessment attempt and will not be capped. However, grades from failed attempt(s) will be recorded in the progress report and transcript. If the student has to repeat the course in another semester, the failed attempt will contribute towards the GPA. CGPA will only be calculated based on the student’s latest reassessment attempt.

- The maximum mark that can be awarded for any course after reassessment due to course failure or component failure is the minimum passing mark (applicable for intakes prior to August 2019). If the previous mark and the reassessed marks are below the minimum pass mark, then the highest of the marks for the course and/or component will be counted as the final mark.

- Students from the 2013 intake onwards are allowed to repeat a passed course if required for professional accreditation under specific accreditation arrangements. However, the marks obtained in the subsequent attempt(s) will not be recorded on the student’s transcript and will not be used in any calculation of the student’s programme marks or grade. The marks and/or grades of any assessment repeated for professional accreditation will be recorded in a separate letter issued by the registrar to confirm the examination results.

Lecturers setting coursework for re-sit must fulfill the following criteria:
i. Only set for 1 coursework (not required to follow existing coursework components setting).
ii. Coursework weightage must be at least 30% of the overall subject.
iii. Coursework must be individual work.





**Condonement**

A student who, after failing all opportunities to pass a course but has achieved a mark of between 30% and 39% in any of the attempts, may be given condonement for the said course. The failed course must be proposed to the Programme Assessment Board for condonement. The maximum that can be condoned is 12 credits for a bachelor’s degree. Conditions for condonement are as follows:

i) All programme learning outcomes continue to be met;  
ii) The mark for the course is at least 30% in any of the attempts;  
iii) The mark for the failed assessment component (referring to component failure) is no more than 10% below the minimum component pass mark in any of the attempts;  
iv) The student’s CGPA at the time of condonement is at least 2.00;  
v) Professional body requirements do not stipulate that all assessment components must be passed and do not prohibit condonement.





**Mandatory Exit**

A student with outstanding failures after all opportunities for reassessment have been exhausted will be required to exit from the programme.





**Programme Award and Results**

Awards are recommended by the Programme Assessment Board (PAB). In order to be recommended for the award, students must have:

- Achieved passes in the credit requirements specified for the award.
- Passed any additional requirements specified by the programme associated with the award, including compulsory courses, defined combinations of courses, and placements.
- Achieved a CGPA greater than or equal to 2.00 from courses that are taken into account towards the award classification.
- Met any required professional or statutory body requirements for the award.





**Honours Degree Award Classification**

The classification of awards will be based on the cumulative grade points average of contributing courses. The contributing courses for an honours degree are derived from the results of Year 2 and Year 3 only. Typically, for bachelor’s level, Year 1 courses, MPU courses, and internships are not calculated towards the overall award marks and classification. 

The classification of degree awards with honours is as follows:

CGPA Classification:

- 3.50 – 4.00: Class I
- 3.00 – 3.49: Class II - I
- 2.50 – 2.99: Class II - II
- 2.00 – 2.49: Class III





**Calculation of Grade Point Average**

Grade Point Average (GPA) is calculated by multiplying the grading point by course credit and dividing the figure by the total number of credits taken in a semester. The formula is as follows:

GPA = Sum of (Grading Point x Course Credits) for all courses / Sum (Total Number of Credits)

Upon completion of study, students will receive a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). Students may refer to the academic regulations for a sample calculation of GPA and CGPA.





**Higher Class Award**

A higher class shall be awarded when a student’s overall profile falls into the following scenario:
i) The Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) is not more than 0.05 points below the recommended class; and  
ii) At least half of the counting credits, or half + 0.5 in the case of an uneven number of credits, are in the recommended class.





**Academic Standing**

Determination of students’ academic standing is based on GPA and CGPA:

i) **Good Standing** - A student is in good standing whenever the student’s CGPA is 2.00 or above.  
ii) **Warning** - Whenever the GPA for any enrolment period is less than 2.00, but the CGPA is 2.00 or above, the student will receive a warning notification.  
iii) **Probation** - The student will be placed on probation whenever the student’s CGPA falls below 2.00.  
iv) **Extended Probation** - The student will be placed on extended probation when, following a semester on probation, the student’s CGPA is still below 2.00, even though the GPA for the enrolment period is 2.00 or above. Students with this status may only be permitted to register for a maximum of 12 credits.  
v) **Final Probation** - The student will be placed on final probation when, following a semester on extended probation, the student’s CGPA continues to be below 2.00, even though the student’s GPA for the enrolment period is 2.00 or above. Students may only register for no more than 12 credits in that particular semester.  
vi) **Dismissal** - Students on extended probation who fail to achieve at least a 2.00 GPA for the enrolment period, or students on final probation who fail to achieve a 2.00 CGPA, will have to exit the programme.





**Appeal Process**

A student who is dissatisfied with the result of an examination or other decisions by the assessment board may submit a formal application of appeal to either the Examination Unit or School. Please refer to the student handbook for more details.





**Graduation**

The graduation registration details will be sent to your personal email before the graduation ceremony. Graduands are required to reply by the stipulated deadline.
